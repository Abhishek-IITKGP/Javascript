//JS uses automatic memory management where it uses *****garbage collection**** method to allocate and deallocate memory.
//when the variable or object are in no use they become eligible for garbage collection for reclaiming the memory space.

//Primitive datatypes => stored in Stack memory.
//Non-premitive dattype => Stored in Heap memory.

//To manage memory in any programming language a garbadge collector is there that automatically allocated and dellocate memory.

//*************STACK**************//
//copy of the refernce is allocated to the variable
//No change in the actual variable data

//**************HEAP***************//
//Actual reference is allocated to the variable
//memory is allocated for the object and reference to the data.
